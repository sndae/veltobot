Balancing robot using accelerometer and gyro to measure angle. Dc motors is used for driving the motors. The software is implemented in Arduino(C++), but may be switched to a faster microcontroller later if necessary. A goal for the project is to make a state observator for estimating the speed of the motors, to "replace" encoders. The control algorithm is tuned wireless from a computer using Xbee-modules. The software on the computer is GUI-based and written in Java using NetBeans. To make serial communication the widely used RXTX.org liberary for java is used.
